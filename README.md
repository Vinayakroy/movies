# Movies

## Tutorial: movies

This project is a backend API built with Spring Boot designed to manage information about movies and their reviews. It provides RESTful endpoints that allow a frontend application to fetch details for all movies or a single movie, and also to add new reviews linked to specific movies. All the movie and review data is persistently stored in a MongoDB database, and the application includes a CORS configuration to securely allow a web frontend to communicate with it.
